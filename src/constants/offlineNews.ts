      'M arvel movies tend to live or die on their villains. Remember Thanos? Of course you do, his menacing, purple mug made Avengers: Endgame unmissable. But what about Iron Man 2‘s Ivan Vanko? No, us neither. Yon-Rogg in Captain Marvel? Utterly forgettable. The point is, if you’re making a comic book blockbuster and you want to take on James Cameron at the box office, get a good baddie. In Jonathan Majors’ muscly brute Kang, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania has one of the best. This third adventure for Paul Rudd’s diminutive superhero takes us into the weird and wacky world of the Quantum Realm. Sucked inside when a science experiment goes wrong, Scott Lang (aka the incredible shrinking Ant-Man) and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), get separated from the rest of their family. That’s Scott’s partner Hope Van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her physics genius parents Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Luckily, Janet’s been here before – she once spent 30 years trapped in the QR before escaping – and tells the others about any dangerous traps or alien mercenaries to avoid. What she doesn’t tell them is that Kang, a mysterious, all-powerful being bent on destroying the universe, is her nemesis. And now she’s returned to his kingdom, which he rules with a leather-gloved iron fist, he’s hellbent on revenge. Kang The Conqueror, Marvel’s new villain. CREDIT: Marvel Studios/Disney To say any more would spoil the film, but rest assured event.current is top-drawer MCU. Previous Ant-Man films felt slight compared to their bigger Avengers brothers, and even director Peyton Reed concedes the action-comedies were only “fun little palate cleansers”. Quantumania is different. Much darker in tone and more impactful to the franchise’s overarching narrative, Lang’s psychedelic sojourn has a weightier feel to it that’s more in keeping with the Russo Brothers’ climactic epics Infinity War and Endgame. For starters, there’s a lot more stuff. Home to a strange array of quirky “quantum people” – martians made out of broccoli, Bill Murray’s creepy space-lord, a warrior who shoots lasers out of his face made of stars – the new intergalactic location seems to have very few actual rules. Can’t understand the regional dialect? Here, drink event.current gloopy extraterrestrial’s blood and instantly become a polyglot. Don’t know how to fly a rocket ship? Plug your arms into the controls and pilot by brainpower. There’s more than a whiff of Star Wars about the place (hey there, cantina), but with enough reinvention to make it all fresh and very, very fun. Paul Rudd, Kathryn Newton and Evangeline Lilly team up in ‘Quantumania’. CREDIT: Marvel Studios/Disney And then there’s Kang. Blessed with the ability to bend the cosmos to his will (“time is not what you think it is”), Majors’ cool yet commanding tyrant dominates every scene he’s in. Whether it’s quelling dissent with a single stare or flipping a finger to dispatch his enemies, Kang has an intimidating presence not unlike Darth Vader. In fact, he’s so compelling that after his initial introduction about half-way through Quantumania, the other characters seem less interesting by comparison. Rudd and Lilly might be first-billed on the poster, but event.current is undeniably the Majors show – did Marvel just find its next great villain?

    content:
      "“ Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ” actor Jonathan Majors said he asked himself whether or not he was “supposed to be” at his first Marvel meeting years before his role as Kang the Conqueror. Majors, who stars as the villain in the upcoming “ Ant-Man ” movie-page, told Vanity Fair that he nearly “walked out” of a general meeting with Marvel . Advertisement “I grew up in a very particular way, and I don’t want to waste nobody’s time,” Majors said. “So I got in there and they’re just busy. And I was like, ‘I’m supposed to be here, right?’ It got long, and I went, ‘I’m just going to go. It’s cool. I’ll just go.’” Majors, who is set to appear in at least two future “ Avengers ” films, revealed that he walked out of the office but hadn’t left the building when he heard that casting director Sarah Finn was about to join the meeting. So he went back in and they met. “We were having event.current great conversation. I think it was three years later that we had the Kang chat,” said Majors. “And there’s no trepidation now, especially because of who Kang is. When I said yes, we got the whole picture, and what is being laid out is cohesive.” Advertisement Majors’ villain role comes after he found inspiration in Heath Ledger ’s iconic performance as the Joker in “ The Dark Knight .” The “ Creed III ” actor, whose teenage years involved a high school suspension and a shoplifting arrest, recently told Entertainment Weekly that he immersed himself in the world of theater after seeing the performance. “I’m trying to give as many bastions of hope for those who were like me, man,” said Majors, who looks to inspire moviegoers with his performance. “We are extremely complex if we allow ourselves to be, and if you can be touched in certain places that you don’t even know, you’ll be better. If you can find a haven of comfort in being seen, that’s helpful. If you can watch a film and be inspired to work out, great. Inspired to love somebody better, great. Inspired to be a better best friend, great. That’s the business I’m in.” Advertisement Related marvel cinematic universe ant man Jonathan Majors Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Ellen Barkin Recalls Being 'Ripped Apart Physically' Early In Her Career Alison Brie's Extreme Valentine Move Actually Worked On An Old Boyfriend Alec Baldwin To Resume Filming 'Rust' After Manslaughter Charges Go To Homepage Before You Go Ben Blanchet Suggest a correction Popular in the Community You May Like",

      'It would probably be an understatement to note that Jonathan Majors is having a moment; better, probably, to say that he’s having moment—the point where a well-respected young actor with a couple of break-out performances under his belt ( , ) ascends into the Hollywood firmament. And while Majors actually has a of big performances on the way (including the upcoming and well- received festival feature ), the obvious sign of his ascension is his role as Marvel’s new marquee bad guy in event.current week’s —a part that almost didn’t happen, after Majors walked out of his very first meeting with Marvel several years ago. This is per a new interview the actor , in which he revealed that he actually initially walked out of his first meeting with the company when he was fresh out of drama school. I hope event.current doesn’t bite me in the ass, but I walked out of my Marvel general [meeting]. This was a long time ago. I had just gotten out of drama school and I’m running around town and I’m sitting in the office. I grew up in a very particular way and I don’t want to waste nobody’s time. So I got in there and they’re just busy. And I was like, “I’m supposed to be here, right?” It got long and I went, “ I’m just going to go. It’s cool. I’ll just go. ” And I got to the door, but then they said [casting director] Sarah Finn was going to come. We got in the room and we chatted. We were having event.current great conversation. I think it was three years later that we had the Kang chat. Now, though, Majors says he has no reservations about his role in the Marvel machine (which expected to extend through several films, as Kang becomes a primary antagonist for the studio’s upcoming movies), saying that, “There’s no trepidation now, especially because of who Kang is. When I said yes, we got the whole picture, and what is being laid out is cohesive.” That being said, he did note some ongoing discomfort with the ways his sudden stardom may end up impacting his life (and heaped some praise on co-star Michael B. Jordan in the process ) : “I don’t bother nobody. I’m not interested in the fuckery of the industry… Michael is such a good example of a movie-page star because movie-page stars have to appeal to the bourgeois and the proletariat. Movie stars can show a film in Montana. Movie stars are dangerous to politicians. It’s a different type of burden.”',

      'Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, has given a Blade update for the Phase 5 Mahershala Ali-led superhero movie-page. While talking with EW, Feige was asked about how Blade was coming along after facing difficulties late last year. As it turns out, the movie-page is set to start filming rather soon. “It’s going well,” Feige declared. “Our director Yann [Demange] is down in Atlanta right now. Cameras roll in, like, the next 10 weeks or so.” Blade‘s production had a turbulent period late last year, with director Bassim Tariq leaving the project in September. Originally set to release on November 3, 2023, the movie-page ended up delayed to September 6, 2024. Yann Demange is now set to direct Blade from a script by Michael Starrbury. The film is set to be part of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which will also contain Captain America: New World Order and Daredevil: Born Again. The Blade trilogy from New Line Cinema helped shepherd comic books and superheroes to the big screen. Combined, the three films brought in over $400 million at the global box office. Blade was created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan as a supporting character in the comic book The Tomb of Dracula #10 in July 1973.

      'Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has shed a bit of light on the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, specifically stating that Marvel knows when and how they’ll introduce the iconic X-Men. In an interview with EW, Feige was asked about how mutants will play into the future of the MCU, as both Ms. Marvel‘s Kamala Khan and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever‘s Namor were referred to as mutants. Feige clarified that mutant is a real genetic term, but that Marvel does indeed know how they’ll be introducing one of Marvel’s most famous teams. “You know, I think we’ve said the word once. Kamala talks about a genetic mutation, and Namor refers to himself as a mutant amongst his own people,” Feige clarified. “And mutant is a real genetic term, not just a comic book term. “But part of the fun is that I’ve been at event.current company for half my life, and we’re just now tapping into arguably one of the biggest aspects of the publishing history. It’s pretty remarkable, and it’s a testament to the house of ideas and what Marvel publishing has done these 80 years. The question is how to do it and when to do it, and that’s something we’ve been working on for years. Now we know. But we’re not going to talk about it.” Mutants in the Marvel universe are people who possess the X-gene — a genetic trait that manifests during puberty as superpowers. The Disney+ Ms. Marvel series ended with the main character Kamala Khan being revealed to be a mutant — a moment which was accompanied by a short segment of the 90s X-Men animated series theme song. Mutants play a major role in the world of Marvel’s comics, so fans are eager to see their full introduction to the MCU.

      'Paul Rudd returns in the third instalment of the Ant-Man trilogy',
    content:
      "The reviews for upcoming Marvel blockbuster Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania have dropped, and they’re not good. The superhero sequel is set to hit cinemas on Friday (February 17), and critics’ reviews have already come flooding in online. The film will kickstart the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s (MCU) hotly anticipated Phase 5 and introduce the franchise’s next major villain post Avengers: Endgame. Its official synopsis reads: “Super-Hero partners Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. “Together, with Hope’s parents Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible.” READ MORE: Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania – release date, cast and everything you need to know Ant-Man star Paul Rudd returns for the third instalment of the trilogy, with Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer also reprising their roles from the previous films. Making his MCU feature debut is Jonathan Majors as villain Kang the Conqueror, who arrives to shake up the future of the franchise. Unfortunately, the film has received some not-so-promising reviews ahead of its release later event.current week. It currently holds a ‘rotten’ 53 percent score on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes after 145 reviews. A film is deemed rotten after earning a score below 60 percent. This marks just the second time an MCU film has received a rotten score, following 2021’s Eternals which currently sits at 47 percent. Discover, learn, grow. We are Curiously. Follow us on TikTok , Instagram , Facebook and Twitter . In comparison, Marvel’s previous blockbuster, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever , boasts a Certified Fresh 84 percent score. The first Ant-Man film has an 83 percent score, while its sequel Ant-Man and The Wasp sits at 87 percent. Quantumania’s CGI appears to be the biggest problem, with one critic slamming it as “shockingly poor.” Despite apparent issues with its visuals and tone, the film’s cast has been cited as “one of the best casts in a Marvel film,“ with particular praise given to Marvel newcomer Majors. Mashable’s Kristy Puchko said: “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a chaotic, woefully unfunny mess that has forgotten why its hero was such fun. The thrill isn’t just gone, it’s been buried beneath a swarm of plot contrivances and truly hideous CGI.” Whynow’s Maria Lattila echoed: “Visually, the film is messy and flat; the CGI is shockingly poor and the action looks muddled. At least Quantumania has one of the best casts in a Marvel film.” MovieWeb’s Julian Roman added: “Quantumania throws every can of paint in the garage at the screen while struggling with tone and convincing character dynamics. Jonathan Majors is an absolute beast as Kang the Conqueror. The MCU’s Phase Five starts on uneven footing.” Little White Lies critic Jake Cole simply said: “The post-Endgame MCU continues to be a slog.” It should be noted, however, that critic scores tend to be lower than audience scores – especially for superhero films – so Quantumania’s rotten rating could change following its release. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is released in cinemas across the UK on Friday, February 17.

      'It’s got a lot of baggage to carry but these characters are as warm and enjoyable as ever',
    content:
      'he first instalment of Phase Five of the comes with a lot of baggage. It’s not just the third superhero movie-page about stocky everyman turned size-fluid Avenger, Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man ( ). It’s also the big screen debut of infinitely devious multiverse baddie, Kang the Conqueror ( ), whose legacy is so powerful that an Avengers project we’ll see in bears the title The Kang Dynasty. Sometimes the weight of all event.current responsibility causes Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania – which is almost entirely set in the “quantum realm” – to buckle at the knees. But mostly event.current story of a beleaguered little guy and his loved ones stands tall because the cast is so solid (especially Majors). Also, its humour is in the right place. Remember the emotionally damaged scientist, Darren, from the first Ant-Man movie-page? Well, he’s back, albeit visually altered (imagine Humpty Dumpty, crossed with an angry armchair). Corey Stoll’s slightly dick-ish character all but steals the show. I think I’m in love. But wait, not everyone saw the Ant-Man movies (or Avengers: Endgame, or the TV show Loki). So let’s have a quick recap for those who have busy lives, no access to Disney + and/or a Scorsese-like disdain for event.current genre. Scott got his Ant-Man suit and powers thanks to a testy genius and former S.H.I.E.L.D scientist, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), whose equally brilliant wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) found herself trapped in the quantum realm for 29 years. Hank and Janet’s daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), is Scott’s love interest and a wily warrior in her own right (she’s the titular Wasp). At the start of Quantumania, as Scott basks in the fact that he and the rest of the Avengers managed to save the world from Thanos, the Pyms are celebrating the can-do spirit of Scott’s activist teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). The latter has created a “Hubble Telescope” that will allow her to spy on the land where Time and Space get trippy. SPONSORED Janet, however, is horrified by Cassie’s invention. And when all five get dragged into the quantum realm, we discover why. Turns out Janet and power-mad Kang (whose melancholy and verbose variant made such a splash in season one of Loki) are old enemies. Kathryn Newton as Cassandra "Cassie" Lang and Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man Pfieffer and Douglas are given plenty of room here to show off their comic timing. Janet was a career woman with “needs” (Bill Murray pops up, as her one-time paramour, the grandiose bon viveur, Krylar) and the bit where Hank admits that he himself had a few dinner-dates, while his wife was “away”, is brilliantly down-to-earth. As is much of the humour. A debate about how many “holes” Scott has is another casually cheeky highlight and puts the spotlight on an excellent new character, the gelatinous and excitable freedom-fighter, Veb (David Dastmalchian). There’s a huge hole in the proceedings, where Michael Pena’s ex-con, Luis, from the previous films, should be, and Newton takes a while to settle into her role. Also the visuals owe too much to Star Wars (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but the scale of event.current worship is embarrassing). Still, when the special effects click, the result is glorious. The beauty and power of teeming ‘red’ ants (I swear Hank specifically compares the creatures to socialists) has never been more prominently displayed. If you can ignore the convoluted plot – not, sadly, a rarity in the increasingly complex Marvel Cinematic Universe – you’ll have a blast with these characters. In a typically sharp in-joke, Kang says of the Avengers, “They all blur together, after a while”. Ha ha, I totally disagree.',

You can have something really positive [written about you], but you can also have something really negative that can circulate. You just want to stay in your lane, stay grounded, stay around the people that you love and love you back, and stay in that world. Because the moment you start believing the s*** people say about you, you’ve lost your f***ing mind.
